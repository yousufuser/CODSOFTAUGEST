        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>The Government College of Engineering and Leather Technology (GCELT) was established in 1919 on being recommended by the Munitions Board after the First World War to use indigenous resources of hides, skins and tanning materials for producing leather goods and the development of leather industry in India.[3]

It was known as Calcutta Research Tannery and was renamed to Bengal Tanning Institute in 1926. The institute became affiliated to Calcutta University and introduced a Certificate Course in tanning. In 1955, the B.Sc. (Tech) course in Leather Technology was introduced. The name of the institute was changed in 1958 to College of Leather Technology.[3]

Calcutta Research Tannery as well as Bengal Tanning Institute was situated at the campus of Canal South Road, Beleghata (presently that place is the campus of RCCIIT college). In 1994, the campus was moved from there to the present address of Salt Lake City.[3]

In 1999–2000, apart from the B.Tech in Leather Technology that it was offering, the college started offering B.Tech. in Information Technology and in 2000–2001 B.Tech. in Computer Science & Technology.</p>
